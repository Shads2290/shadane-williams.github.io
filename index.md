# Shadane's Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](https://github.com/Shads2290/shadane-williams.github.io/blob/master/Projects/Linear_reg_project.ipynb)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg"/>

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Identifying Customers Likely to Subscribe for Term Deposit](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1h3Rnc_h4cgTWTaLEYmQDgoLqIJdiNlsc)

<img src="images/bank.jpeg"/>

- Used logistic regression to identify potential bankers based on various attributes
- Implemented SMOTE to balance class labels
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Create the confusion matrix for the predictions and make note of the outputs
- Created a classification report and eplored the various outputs

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Sk_SQlq-TWaYNEpIgdz4l3TOttzcIYcS?usp=sharing)

<img src= "images/bone%20infarct%20xray.jpeg"/>

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance
