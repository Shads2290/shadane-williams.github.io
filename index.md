# Shadane's Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](https://github.com/Shads2290/shadane-williams.github.io/blob/master/Projects/Linear_reg_project.ipynb)

<img src="Seoul Bike Rental.jpeg"/>

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Sk_SQlq-TWaYNEpIgdz4l3TOttzcIYcS?usp=sharing)

<img src="images/knee-brace-ortho.png?raw=true"/>

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance
